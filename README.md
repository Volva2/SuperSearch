# SuperSearch
#### A simple files and file contents search app for windows.


# If using as shorcut from window runnable
For faster starts, if you are running the app from desktop using a shortcut, disable SysMain startup in Services by running `services.msc` in Run.

# Searching for files
You can search for files by first typing `in:` and then writing whatever you are searching for

You can use symbols like `*` to search for more than exact matches, like `in:*Author-name.pdf`
